// smallestPowerOfTwo(), which should take in an array and return the lowest power of 2 that is greater than or equal to each number in that array. A power of two is any value 2n where n is a non-negative integer (including 0). The list of powers of 2 for non-negative integers starts with [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64,...] where 20=1, 21=2, 22=4, and so on.

// const myArray = [6, 2, 11, 50];

// function smallestPowerOfTwo(array){
// for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++){

// }
// }
